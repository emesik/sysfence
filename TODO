    !   this is a major bug and/or lack of functionality and should be fixed
        ASAP.
    +   this is potentially useful enchancement.
    -   minor improvement.


 So, current TODO is:

    !   stopped 'sfwatch' should exit after SIGTERM

    !   uid list requires whitespace after separator

    !   better handling of statfs() errors

    +   ports to other systems
        . *BSD - AFAIK, these support proc fs, so it looks easy
        . uther unices (looking for info & help)
