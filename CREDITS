        - cleaned up the code, reduced gcc warnings, wrote new Makefile

        - made a patch for non-vanilla kernels
        """
        I tried to use sysfence 1.5 on SuSe 9.3 but the memory data
        was not correct. I figured out this was due to the fact that
        the 2 summary lines in /proc/meminfo were not there (I don't
        know if that is typical for SuSe or for kernel 2.6). I
        patched the code so that now it looks for the keywords
        MemTotal, Buffers, Cached etc. The keywords can be in any
        order and they are there for Redhat 8.0 (2.4 kernel) and
        Suse 9.3 (2.6 kernel).
